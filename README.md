# Recurrent Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis

This reporsitory contains a simple implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets in Spanish from Mexico labeled as positive or negative.

## The data

We are using the [SENT-COVID](https://github.com/GIL-UNAM/SENT-COVID) dataset.
